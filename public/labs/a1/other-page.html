        This assignment describes how to install the development environment for creating and working with Web applications we will be developing this semester. We will add new content every week, pushing the code to a GitHub source repository, and then deploying the content to a remote server hosted on Netlify.

Web pages consist of text documents that contain plain text formatted with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tags embedded within the text. HTML is a computer language used to format the content displayed in Web pages. The formatting consists of configuring the foreground and background color, adding white spaces between text, aligning text, configuring font, creating lists, tables, and forms. In this assignment we will learn how to use HTML to format plain text into Web pages.

Assignments in this course contain three main sections: Lab and Tuiter. In the Lab sections we hand hold you through several exercises intended for you to practice various skills. The Lab section in this assignment will give you an opportunity to practice the concepts described in this assignment, i.e., HTML. Once you've had a chance to practice with HTML, in the Tuiter section you'll be asked to apply what you've learned to building a Website inspired on a popular social network site.
